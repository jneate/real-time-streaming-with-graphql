# GraphiQL Setup

This UI is standalone and requires nothing except an internet connection and browser.

Open the HTML file in your favourite browser and you are presented with the GraphiQL Interface.

This particular HTML file is modified from the original GraphiQL CDN so that it can use GraphQL-WS for this projects subscriptions implementation.
